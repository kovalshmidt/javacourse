#Definition
The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal
state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines. The state pattern can be interpreted as a
strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.
