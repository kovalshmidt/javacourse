In computer programming, a thread pool is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of execution in
a computer program. Often also called a replicated workers or worker-crew model,[1] a thread pool maintains multiple
threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program. By maintaining a pool of
 threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation and destruction of threads
 for short-lived tasks.[2] The number of available threads is tuned to the computing resources available to the program,
  such as a parallel task queue after completion of execution.
