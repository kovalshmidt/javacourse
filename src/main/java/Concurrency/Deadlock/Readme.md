In concurrent computing, a deadlock is a state in which each member of a group waits for another member, including itself, to take action, such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a lock.[1] Deadlocks are a common problem in multiprocessing systems, parallel computing, and distributed systems, where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization.[2]
